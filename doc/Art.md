# Art and Interface

## Overview

##### The style of the game is going to be centered around a subtly dark and mysterious tone. We hope to convey the fear that the cat is feeling throughtout his adventure through the art and style we create for the game. We will be creating our own character designs for both the player and the enemies, but will most likely be using assests avaliable to us for the the environment.

##### Our user interface will be focused mainly inside our battle system and through the exploration of the world. The battle system will contain time-based elements in which the user will have to press the correct button at the correct time in order to dodge enemies attack and eventually prevail in battle. The user will also be given a world in which they can freely move and interact with occasional puzzles. The control scheme will be basic and will focus on using the arrow keys to move as well as dodge enemy attacks in battle and the user will occasionally use the spacebar to interact with the world around them. Menu systems will be basic as well and use the arrow keys to select the option and enter to select it. During battle, we will need to provide a health bar to inform the player of their remaining health and a visual representation of the keys that need to be pressed when they reach the specified area of the screen.
