# Art and Interface

## Instructions
Describe how your game looks and feels.  Does it have a visual style?  How will you gather art for the game?  How does the user interact with your game?  Describe both the interface and the control scheme(s).  What are the user interface requirements (health bars, ammo, units, etc.)?  

*Milestone 1 must include a UI prototype with a mockup of all menus, user interfaces and example game screens.*  While these will be a rough draft, it is expected that each group will spend time thinking about what the user really needs and how the game will look.  Having a solid plan makes implementing the game easier later. *In subsequent milestones, you will refine the concept and add details (especially screenshots, etc.).*

_You can incorporate images into this document by adding them to the folder and then linking them. For example:_
![Art example alt text](art-example.jpg)

_The remaining sections in this document are a rough guide. You can use/change them as you see fit._
