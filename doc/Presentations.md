## Instructions
The general guideline for a non-lecture PowerPoint slide is 5x5: _No more than 5 bullet points, no more than 5 words per bullet point._  The slide is there so the audience understands what you’ll be talking about.  It does not take the place of the speaker.  This means you should know what you’ll say during that slide.  

I suggest you practice in front of (at least) your team.  Actually present to yourselves and speak out loud so you understand the pacing and how each topics flows into the next.  

With each milestone, **add a link in the table above to your presentation slides** (I'm assuming these will be in Google Slides) AND **make a few notes in this document** about how you went about planning and practicing for this presentation. 

## Milestone 1
The planning and creation of the presentation was done in our second outside of class group meeting. It was split based off of what each person did outside of the class and meetings. For example, Emily Z. and Alexa did concept art so they created and practiced the slides for anything concept art related. The rest of the slides were created by those who put more focus onto that topic. Each individual practiced their own slides they created and plan on talking about in the presentation by preparing what they want to say and mock presenting.
