## Instructions
The general guideline for a non-lecture PowerPoint slide is 5x5: _No more than 5 bullet points, no more than 5 words per bullet point._  The slide is there so the audience understands what you’ll be talking about.  It does not take the place of the speaker.  This means you should know what you’ll say during that slide.  

I suggest you practice in front of (at least) your team.  Actually present to yourselves and speak out loud so you understand the pacing and how each topics flows into the next.  

_Each section below contains an outline of what is expected of you for that milestone's presentation._

*With each milestone, add a link in the table above to your presentation slides (I'm assuming these will be in Google Slides).*

## Milestone 1
Here is where you will present your group to the class.  Your group is your game studio, and your presentation is like a game pitch.  It tells the audience what you’re building, why you’re making it and how you plan on accomplishing what you’ve decided to create.

Each section of the presentation will be a summary of your documentation.  However, *don’t just copy and paste your write-up into a PowerPoint slide*; summarize the major points and explain them to the class.

Your presentation should contain each of the following four sections, with about 1 – 3 slides per topic depending on detail and visuals:
- *Design*: Talk about the design of your game: What type of game is it?  Does it draw upon other similar games?  What makes it unique, special, exciting, fun? Why are you excited to create it?
- *Architecture*: What will you need to do to make the game?  What are the general classes that will be required?  You must show a basic diagram of the classes and their relationships. Be sure to include this in your write-ups, too.  
- *Art and Interface*: What will the visual (art) style of the game be? What will we see on the screen?  What types of menus will we encounter?  What will the overall flow of your game be?  Show some of the interface mock-ups you’ve done and explain the choices you’ve made.
- *Production*: What is your game’s timeline?  Which pieces of the game are necessary vs. “if we have time”? What is your weekly meeting time?  How have they been going?  Have you been using any external tools (Google Docs, Google Calendar, Trello, etc.) to keep track of tasks and timelines?  

## Milestone 2
Your group will present your progress up to this point.  

Using a shorter PowerPoint presentation than your first one, discuss anything that has changed since your initial plan: any changes to architecture, design, interfaces, or your timelines. 

Discuss where your group feels they are in the development timeline, and what they expect to have done for the next milestone.  

Lastly, demonstrate your game.  

## Milestone 3
Similar to the last milestone, your group will present your progress up to this point.  

Using a shorter PowerPoint presentation than your first or second ones, briefly mention everything that has been implemented in your game thus far.   

Next, discuss what you must implement for the last (and final!) milestone.  

Additionally, discuss your stretch goals and which ones you may have time to implement.  

Lastly, demonstrate your game.  

## Milestone 4
Create one (or more) slides for each of the following topics:
- What went right?
- What went wrong?
- What will you do differently in the future based on what you learned from this project?

Each member should have something to say for at least one of those questions.  

Lastly, demonstrate your game.
