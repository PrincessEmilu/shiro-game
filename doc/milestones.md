# Milestones
_With each milestone, give a _brief_ (3-4 paragraphs at most) summary of what was accomplished during the milestone, any major lessons learned, and how your experience in that milestone influenced your plans for the next (or how you changed things during this milestone based on last time)._

## Milestone 1
During this milestone, we focused on creating a base game idea and designing our way to achieve this idea. We spent a lot of time creating diagrams and completing the necessary documentation to solidify our idea. Because design was our main focus for this milestone, we spent a lot of time discussing and formulating our ideas and plans. Through this process, we now have a solid design plan and will be able to move towards the next milestone with confidenece in our plan and a desire to see our ideas materialized. 

This milestone was heavily based on communication. Most of our time was spent communicating with each other to make sure our ideas were heard and acknowledged. This importance on the disscussion of ides, led to us meeting regularly and devoting oursevles to creating and solidifying a game that we would all be happy to work on. Through this constant communication, we learned the most important lesson of this milestone: simply being able to work well with each other. This lesson was fairly easy for our team to learn. Within the first meeting we were able to create a solid idea that had a small piece of everyone inside of it and we are all working equally as hard to see it come to life. As a team, we rarely have to assign roles as we all willing claim tasks that we have an interest in and we willing accept any leftover tasks. After that first meeting, we were able to speak with each other comfortably and attend to tasks with littles problems. 

Being able to communicate our ideas effectively is a very important lesson that will be very useful throughout the rest of the milestones. As a group project, we will need to listen to each others idea and be able to effectively handle any disagreements that arise. The ability to assign our own task and accept any remaining task will also prove useful in future milestones as we will be able to avoid unneccesary arguments about the assigning of tasks. All in all, we believe that the comunication lessons we learned and the relationship we have established as a group will prove very beneficial to us in future milestones.

## Milestone 2
Working on Milestone 2 has been a very different experience from working on Milestone 1. The reason for this is definitely actually *working* on coding instead of simply
creating plans. However, what hasn't changed is our group's efficiency in communication and our dedication to the project. While we have faced new challenges, we have
continued to meet consistently and work as a team.

For most of us, this project is our first time coding the same project as a team. Coding together is both exciting and challenging. On one hand, there's a very satisfying
feeling of being able to work on one piece of coding, such as a battle system, while another person works on creating a scrolling overworld. By the time you're ready
to show off progress on your segment of the project, another person is ready to show that they completed a task just as valuable as you have. On the other hand, it
is sometimes difficult to interactivity between classes and game states. However, when one person gets stuck on a particular problem or two code segments conflict, we
are  able to talk about the issue as a team and figure out a resolution.

We have gotten better at communicating outside of class and at delegating tasks among group members. Thanks to Professor Mesh and TA Ben, we have also learned how to
more effectively use Trello to organize and delegate tasks. We are using that in conjunction with group texting to make both make sure we finish tasks on-time and to
keep track of issues that need to be fixed as they come up. With such a large project, minor issues can be very easy to miss, so we hope to make sure we don't forget
any important details in our game moving forward.

## Milestone 3
Milestone 3 has sene the implementation of all of our basic game algorithms and data structures. We've finally managed to start designing levels and importing them from files instead
of simply hard-coding values for testing. What is most striking to our team is how our project is starting to look and feel like a game. Up until this point, it has always
looked like and functioned like some sort of experimental tech demo- in a sense, that has been all it was.

This milestone has requried a lot of additional work. We have held extra meetings to work on solving coding problems and implementing new features, and we have each worked individually
on features more than we have in the past. As exciting as it is to see the scattered pieces of our game tech finally coming together, it has come with the realization that some
of the pieces now need to be re-tooled to fit together properly, and as such some of our designs have changed. These changes are reflected in the documnetation.

Our team has had to struggle with workload from our other classes as well. However, we have been managing to stick to our meeting schedules. We have also been communicating via
text more frequently so that we can stay updated about various fixes and changes that need to be done, as well as our individual progress with what we have managed to fix.
