# Milestones
*With each milestone, you'll update the detailed documentation in [doc/]. Here, give a _brief_ (2-3 paragraphs at most) summary of what was accomplished during the milestone, any major lessons learned, and how your experience in that milestone influenced your plans for the next (or how you changed things during this milestone based on last time).*

## Milestone 1: Design and Architecture (Due )
*Creating a plan*
_You main goal for milestone 1 is establishing your game concept, game play, and a prioritized feature list. Once you have this, you'll make initial art/UI mockups and start your technical design (state machines, classes, etc.). During milestone 1, you'll also establish how your team will keep itself organized and manage tasks._

## Milestone 2: Bare Bones Game (Due )
*Starting the technology*
_Your main goal for milestone 2 is getting a “bare bones” version of your game up and running.  This means the game should start up and there is some core functionality present, such as character movement, game states, a menu system, etc.  It is a good idea to have code stubs for most components, in addition to working implementations of core functionality._

_Since the games are required to be data-driven, your team must develop one external tool that helps to get data into a useable format for your game.  These tools should allow the team to quickly and easily alter some core data that the game uses.  This data will be stored in an external file, and read in when the game starts. The tool does not have to be 100% complete for this milestone, but it should be functional._

## Milestone 3: First Playable (Due )
*It's almost a game, kind of, soft of...*
_You should have a basic working game for this milestone. You have four main goals for this part of your assignment:_
- _Finalize basic game algorithms_
- _Implement all game states_
- _Finish the external tool_
- _Continue implementing gameplay logic and algorithms_

## Milestone 4: A Polished Game (Due )
*Hey, look what we did!*
_Your assignment is to finish your game for this milestone.  If you have extra time, feel free to polish the game, add extra levels or implement any of your “extra” features._
 _In addition to wrapping up the project and making sure all documentation is accurate, you'll work as a team to complete a [project post-mortem](postmortem.md)._
