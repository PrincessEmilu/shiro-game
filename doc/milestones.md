# Milestones
_With each milestone, give a _brief_ (3-4 paragraphs at most) summary of what was accomplished during the milestone, any major lessons learned, and how your experience in that milestone influenced your plans for the next (or how you changed things during this milestone based on last time)._

## Milestone 1
During this milestone, we focused on creating a base game idea and designing our way to achieve this idea. We spent a lot of time creating diagrams and completing the necessary documentation to solidify our idea. Because design was our main focus for this milestone, we spent a lot of time discussing and formulating our ideas and plans. Through this process, we now have a solid design plan and will be able to move towards the next milestone with confidenece in our plan and a desire to see our ideas materialized. 

This milestone was heavily based on communication. Most of our time was spent communicating with each other to make sure our ideas were heard and acknowledged. This importance on the disscussion of ides, led to us meeting regularly and devoting oursevles to creating and solidifying a game that we would all be happy to work on. Through this constant communication, we learned the most important lesson of this milestone: simply being able to work well with each other. This lesson was fairly easy for our team to learn. Within the first meeting we were able to create a solid idea that had a small piece of everyone inside of it and we are all working equally as hard to see it come to life. As a team, we rarely have to assign roles as we all willing claim tasks that we have an interest in and we willing accept any leftover tasks. After that first meeting, we were able to speak with each other comfortably and attend to tasks with littles problems. 

Being able to communicate our ideas effectively is a very important lesson that will be very useful throughout the rest of the milestones. As a group project, we will need to listen to each others idea and be able to effectively handle any disagreements that arise. The ability to assign our own task and accept any remaining task will also prove useful in future milestones as we will be able to avoid unneccesary arguments about the assigning of tasks. All in all, we believe that the comunication lessons we learned and the relationship we have established as a group will prove very beneficial to us in future milestones.
