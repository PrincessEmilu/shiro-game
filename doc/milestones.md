# Milestones
_With each milestone, give a _brief_ (3-4 paragraphs at most) summary of what was accomplished during the milestone, any major lessons learned, and how your experience in that milestone influenced your plans for the next (or how you changed things during this milestone based on last time)._

## Milestone 1
During this milestone, we focused on creating a base game idea and designing our way to achieve this idea. We spent a lot of time creating diagrams and completing the necessary documentation to solidify our idea. Because design was our main focus for this milestone, we spent a lot of time discussing and formulating our ideas and plans. Through this process, we now have a solid design plan and will be able to move towards the next milestone with confidenece in our plan and a desire to see our ideas materialized.
