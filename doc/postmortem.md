# Shiro Postmortem

Our team of Game Design and Development (GDD) students in a first year course at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) first met in February.
Knowing very little about each other or about working on a large game project as a team, we didn't know exactly what to expect from our project. After
talking about the various genres we wanted to work on, we came up with the idea of a story-driven game about a cat wanting to get home. Initially, we had
concernes about scope of the project, but we were convinced that we would learn a lot about game development could create something unique if we went forward
with our idea of the lost cat facing his fears on a journey home.

## What Went Right:

Participation

Everyone was heard

Art Style

External Tools

## What Went Wrong:

Messy Code
Coordinating code
Quick Fixes

Prioritizing

Architecture

## What We Learned:

Group work is different than personal work

Architecture is more important than we realized

The Importance of Playtesting

## What We Would Do Differently:
 
Explaining our code to each other more effectively

Plan out architecture better

Organization - tasks - use trello more

Used Data Structures More Effciently - Design Patterns
