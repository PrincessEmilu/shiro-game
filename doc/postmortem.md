# Project Postmortem

## Instructions
Your write-up for Milestone 4 should be in the style of a postmortem.  A postmortem is basically an analysis of a recently completed event.  

In the world of games, developers often do postmortems after completing a game.  The major sections of a game development postmortem are:
- What went right?
- What went wrong?
- What did you learn from this process?
- What will you do differently next time? 

Make sure to consider each question from the perspective of the game itself (concept, art, etc.), architecture, implementation, project management, team organization, etc.

To get a feel for postmortems, check out some of the [game postmortems from Gamasutra](http://www.gamasutra.com/features/postmortem/).

Choose two (or more) of the nearly 200 postmortems and read them fully.  Many games are represented; some date back as far as 1997.    

Your write-up should contain the following:
1.	What went right?
2.	What went wrong?
3.	What did you learn from this project?
4.	What will you do differently next time?
