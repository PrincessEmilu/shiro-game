# Shiro Postmortem

Our team of Game Design and Development (GDD) students in a first year course at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) first met in February.
Knowing very little about each other or about working on a large game project as a team, we didn't know exactly what to expect from our project. After
talking about the various genres we wanted to work on, we came up with the idea of a story-driven game about a cat wanting to get home. Initially, we had
concerns about scope of the project, but we were convinced that we would learn a lot about game development could create something unique if we went forward
with our idea of the lost cat facing his fears on a journey home.

When we started actually coding together at the start of milestone 2, things seemed to be going smoothly for us. We each worked independently on different classes 
and mechanics that we were interested in individually. At first, it seemed like this was a very efficient way to get a lot done. While it certainly was efficient, we 
slowly started to run into some issues with our various pieces of the game actually fitting together. At some points, this caused us a lot of frustration with trying 
to force the pieces together. What had seemed in the beginning to be a simple plan quickly became more complex, due to both our newness with programming in C# and due 
to working on a group coding project, which was unlike anything we had done last semester, or in other classes. Because we had to deal with this difficulty, Shiro 
slowly evolved in how we implemented classes and mechanics from how we originally planned. This evolution however was not strictly negative- new ideas and features 
revealed themselves to us as we continue to code and playtest, and the Shiro we have ended up with is not the same Shiro we started with in our minds.

## What Went Right:

Participation
On top of Milestone Requirements
Everyone was heard

Art Style

External Tools

## What Went Wrong:

Messy Code
Coordinating code
Quick Fixes

Prioritizing

Architecture

## What We Learned:

Group work is different than personal work

Architecture is more important than we realized

The Importance of Playtesting

## What We Would Do Differently:
 
Explaining our code to each other more effectively

Plan out architecture better

Organization - tasks - use trello more

Used Data Structures More Effciently - Design Patterns
