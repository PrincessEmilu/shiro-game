## Scope

### Minumum Viable Product (MVP)
The MVP will be a working battle system that is accesible within a level that the player can walk around in and explore.    

In order to accomplish this, we have identified the following components
*  A level class that can read a text file and intitiaalize a given level
*  A player class that can move around on the screen and interact with objects
*  An enemy class that can colide with the player and initialize a battle
*  A battle class that initializes the battle system
*  A player class that depcits the player in a battle scene and handles animations
*  An enemy class that depicts the enemy in the battle scene and handles attacking
*  A controller object that monitors player condition

### Extra Features
There are several extra features that would make our game shine and be more interesting. In a sense, these are stretch goals that can only
be implemented after getting our main mechanics working.
*  Minor detailed animations
*  Puzzles within levels
*  A save system with checkpoints
*  Music for the levels and the battles
*  A more solid story that uses dialogue and cutscenes
*  Special ambient effects for various environments
*  Ambient sound effects
