# Game Design
**Shiro**  
*By Base 23*
## Overview

### Genre
Primarily, this game will be an RPG with with a very basic story. The player will move around in eight directions in a top-down view of the various levels.
The actual gameplay mechanics of fights will feature rythm-based button presses that will be designed to capture the personality of the fight and the enemies involved. 

### Background Story
The main character of the story, a kitten, is trying to get back home to its family after being washed away in a flood. The kitten has to face things it is
afraid of in the form of battles.

### Objectives
The objective of the game is to *bring that cat home!*  
We want a game to have a sense of atmosphere that the player will feel emotionally invested in. We also want our game to be simple and accesible to all ages and all levels
of gaming experience. We plan on doing this by keeping the game controls simple and presenting the fights in minimalist ways.

### Inspiration and References
A lot of us are inspired by RPG games such as Undertale and Shadow of the Colussus. We appreciate the simple way that games like these are built
and we admire how the stories are more hands-off and told "in the background". The player is meant to experience the game world and feel emotion based on what they 
are seeing and experiencing as the protagonist.

## Game Play

### Game Modes
The game only has one main mode, which is the single player story.  
Within the story, there are two main gameplay states of the game- exploring the world, and fighting an enemy. The game levels will be presented in mostly top-down settings
built with tilesets. When the player engages in a fight, the game will transition to the fight state, which shows the player and the enemy in more of a side-by-side view.
The screen will also show a progressive track that will represent incoming attacks.

### Controls
The game will exclusviely use keyboard controls. The player will use the arrow keys to move, and the spacebar and enter keys to interact with objects and menus.
Battles will require rapid and accurate key presses, but the keys used won't change; what will change will be the speed and patterns of key presses.

### Levels
Our base game will have one main environment: the city. The area is divided into sub-levels, which would essentially be
different screens the player moves through.
The first area of our first level will be designed as a tutorial for the player to get used to the game controls. They will be fairly conventional for moving.  
For the battle system, keys to be pressed will be displayed on the screen and will not deviate from the basic movement and interactive mechanics.

### Player(s)
There will be only one player. The player will basically need two seperate classes for the two game states- in the battle, and in the game world.

### Non-playable characters
There will be enemies that wander around on the game overworld and fight the player in battles. From a design perspective, enemy classes will be very similar to the player
in how they move and how they engage in battles.

## Assets

### Graphics
Our graphics will be vector-based and where possible, digitally hand-drawn by our artists. It will not be feasible for all of our art to come from our team's artists.
We may need to use online resources, such as OpenGameArt, to fill in the gaps.

### Text
We will stick with one font throughout the game to stay consistent.

### Sound
We will most likely get sound effects from an open-source site, such as freesound.org. We may need to employ a similar strategy with music.

### What makes Shiro fun?
Shiro is an exploration game that is desgined to make the player feel for the cat and become determined to get him home to his family. The battles with rhythm key presses make it fun 
for the player to stay in a groove to make sure that they are not defeated. Without the rhythm, the player could potentially lose the groove. Shiro is a fun game to explore his world
and discover how to get him home.

We are currently using a edited version of this free to use tileset. Not only did we change some of the tones in it, but we also added our own tiles.
