# Game Design
**The Cat Game**  
*By Base 23*
## Overview

### Genre
Primarily, this game will be an RPG with with a very basic story. The player will move around in eight directions in a top-down view of the various levels.
The actual gameplay mechanics of fights will feature rythm-based button presses that will be designed to capture the personality of the fight and the enemies involved. 

### Background Story
The main character of the story, a kitten, is trying to get back home to its family after being washed away in a flood.

### Objectives
The objective of the game is to bring that cat home. We want a game to have a sense of atmosphere that helps the player 

### Inspiration and References
A lot of us are inspired by RPG games such as Undertale and Shadow of the Colussus. We appreciate the simple way that games like Undertale are built
and we admire how stories are made more hands-off and told "in the background".

## Game Play

### Game Modes
Story mode. Has explorable overworlds and battle scenes.

### Controls
Keyboard controls. The player will use the arrow keys to move, and the spacebar (or perhaps another key?)

### Levels
Our base game will have three main environments- a sewer, a city, and a forest. Each area is divided into sub-levels, which would essentially be
different screens the player moves through.
The first area of our first level will be designed as a tutorial for the player to get used to the game controls. They will be fairly conventional for moving.  
For the battle system, keys to be pressed will be displayed on the screen and will not deviate from the basic movement and interactive mechanics.

### Player(s)
There will be only one player.

### Non-playable characters
There will be enemies.

## Assets

### Graphics
our graphics will be vector-based and where possible, digitally hand-drawn by our artists. It will not be feasible for all of our art to come from our team's artists.
We may need to use online databases, such as OpenGameArt, to fill in the gaps.
### Text

### Sound
We will most likely get sound effects from an open-source site, such as freesound.org. We may need to employ a similar strategy with music.
