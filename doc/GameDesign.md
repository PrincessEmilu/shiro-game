# Design

## Instructions
Decide how the game should be designed. All games must be 2D, but the design is up to your group. You may want to look at the often unique designs of the games submitted to the Independent Game Festival. Some things to consider:
- What genre is the game? 
- Is it a knockoff game? 
- What are the objectives of the game? 
- How many players does the game allow? 
- Is it turn-based or real-time? 
- What is the look-and-feel of the game? 
- Will the game have multiple levels?
- What makes the game fun?

You should not simply implement an existing game (like Pac Man, Tetris or Chess).  If you want to use an existing game as inspiration, that is great, but make it your own.  Five points of this assignment will be dedicated to the creativity shown in game design.
