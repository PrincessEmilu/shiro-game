- This [UML class diagram reference](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/class-reference.html) probably has more than you'll need, but it's a good starting point.
- [Markdown](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html) is a convenient method of documentation because it can have nice formatting while still being a plain text file (which allows multiple team members to edit sections and view/merge differences). _(I'm requiring it for this project because it also allows me to easily see changes over time and who worked on different sections of a document.)_


_You can incorporate images into this document by adding them to the folder and then linking them using the markdown syntax `![alt text](relative path to image file)`._ 

_For example `![Art example alt text](doc/art_example.jpg)` results in:_

![Art example alt text](doc/art_example.jpg)
