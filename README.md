# Team **Base 23**


## Team

Emily Horton

Destiny Treptau  
Brandon Service  

## Goals
The primary goals of this project are the following:
1. Practice with the development of a larger project over the course of a semester
2. To gain experience working as a part of a small team
3. To implement a variety of game-related algorithms 
4. To implement data structures for a game 
5. To have fun making a game

## Mission Statement
The goal of Base23 is to create a game that is fun and enjoyable for gamers of all ages and skill levels. Our game Shiro will feature a unique battle mechanic that
involves rythm that anyone can understand and play with.

We feel as though our game will be a success as long as people enjoy playing it. We understand that because it is a first-year student project, it will be fairly 
limited in scope and overall polish. However, we have believed from day one that with our combined creativity, we will make a fun game to play.

## Communications

### Discord
This group will use the private Discord channel in the IGME 106 Discord Server.

### Meeting Times
Weekly meetings will be held Friday in GOL 2000 between 4-6PM.

- [Course schedule](https://people.rit.edu/~esmvcs/files/2185/IGME106_Course_Schedule_2185.htm)
- This [UML class diagram reference](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/class-reference.html) probably has more than you'll need, but it's a good starting point.
- [Markdown](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html) is a convenient method of documentation because it can have nice formatting while still being a plain text file (which allows multiple team members to edit sections and view/merge differences). _(I'm requiring it for this project because it also allows me to easily see changes over time and who worked on different sections of a document.)_
