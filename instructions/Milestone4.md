# Milestone 4
**Hey, look what we did!**
_Your assignment is to finish your game for this milestone.  If you have extra time, feel free to polish the game, add extra levels or implement any of your “extra” features. In addition to wrapping up the project and making sure all documentation is accurate, you'll work as a team to complete a [project post-mortem](postmortem.md)._

## [Production](doc/Production.md)
**At the end of milestone 4, you will also write a detailed project [postmortem](doc/postmortem.md).**
A postmortem is basically an analysis of a recently completed event.  

In the world of games, developers often do postmortems after completing a game.  The major sections of a game development postmortem are:
- What went right?
- What went wrong?
- What did you learn from this process?
- What will you do differently next time? 

Make sure to consider each question from the perspective of the game itself (concept, art, etc.), architecture, implementation, project management, team organization, etc.

To get a feel for postmortems, check out some of the [game postmortems from Gamasutra](http://www.gamasutra.com/features/postmortem/).

Choose two (or more) of the nearly 200 postmortems and read them fully.  Many games are represented; some date back as far as 1997.    

## [Presentation](doc/Presentations.md)
Create one (or more) slides for each of the following topics:
- What went right?
- What went wrong?
- What will you do differently in the future based on what you learned from this project?

Each member should have something to say for at least one of those questions.  

Lastly, demonstrate your game.  

## [Implementation](src/ReleaseNotes.md)
**By the end of milestone 4 you should have a polished game that includes all of your MVP (minimum viable product) features.** Be sure to document any known issues!
