# Milestone 3
**It's almost a game, kind of, soft of...**
_You should have a basic working game for this milestone. You have four main goals for this part of your assignment:_
- _Finalize basic game algorithms_
- _Implement all game states_
- _Finish the external tool_
- _Continue implementing gameplay logic and algorithms_

## [Presentation](doc/Presentations.md)
Similar to the last milestone, your group will present your progress up to this point.  

Using a shorter PowerPoint presentation than your first or second ones, briefly mention everything that has been implemented in your game thus far. 

Next, discuss what you must implement for the last (and final!) milestone. 

Additionally, discuss your stretch goals and which ones you may have time to implement.  

Lastly, demonstrate your game.  

## [Implementation](src/ReleaseNotes.md)
**By the end of milestone 3:**
- _Your basic game algorithms (such as collision detection & response, animations, etc.) should be finalized for this milestone._  This means they should work the way you want, so you can move on to other areas of your game for the last milestone.  If you’re stuck or having problems, you can always stop by office hours or ask one of the gaming tutors for help.
- _All “minimally required” states of your game should be reachable._  They don’t have to all work perfectly or look pretty, but they should all be implemented at this stage.  This includes: menus, pause screens, level selection, battle modes, etc.  If you have some extra states that are on your “if we have time” list, they don’t need to be implemented yet.
- _The external tool should be finished so that it can be used for the last milestone._  It should read & write files as necessary to create maps, settings, etc. for your game.  
- _Other areas of the game should be progressing as well._  After this milestone you only have a few weeks until the game is due.  Follow your group’s timeline and make adjustments where necessary.

You may also find it useful to implement some of the new data structures and algorithms we have talked about this quarter: trees, hash tables, graphs, etc.  While not required, you may find that they can simplify some areas of your code or allow you to implement new features.
